# Claire Gilligan portfolio website

After spending a number of weeks on the [previous iteration](https://clairegilligan.herokuapp.com)
of my website, I [realized that](https://medium.com/@feminaprovita/things-i-learned-building-my-portfolio-site-7abb472599ae?source=friends_link&sk=3d5684ab10c6f127a942352beb24299b),
for a portfolio site, I needed something tighter, simpler, more standard.

Having built this twice, essentially, I've gotten two pretty different learning
experiences, both of which I'm grateful for.

The previous build, originating entirely from my imagination and using the full
stack I learned in bootcamp, had very much been a process of "Wait, didn't I
learn how to do this already? Then why is it taking so much research to accomplish
it correctly now?" (That is, I spent weeks relearning, reinforcing things on my own terms.)

This build has been more "Here's a feature on another site that i want; now how
do I implement it in my own site?" So while I got to copy over some features from
the old site (including the bits with the RegEx I so enjoyed figuring out), I
spent most of my time on CSS (especially Grid and media queries).

This has been a great project, and [I've learned so much in the process](https://medium.com/@feminaprovita/things-i-learned-building-my-portfolio-site-7abb472599ae?source=friends_link&sk=3d5684ab10c6f127a942352beb24299b){target=_blank}!
Thanks for taking the time to look over my code.

Built in Node, using Express for the backend, and React and Webpack (and CSS)
for the frontend.

I'd love to hear what you think! What you liked, what you think I could (or
should) improve&mdash;if you know of a job I should apply for...
