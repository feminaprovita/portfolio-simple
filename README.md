# Claire Gilligan portfolio website

After spending a number of weeks on the [previous iteration](https://clairegilligan.herokuapp.com)
of my website, I realized that, for a portfolio site, I needed something tighter,
simpler, more standard.

While the previous build had very much been a process of "Wait, didn't I learn
how to do this already? Then how am I failing to accomplish it so utterly now?"
&mdash;in other words, a great learning experience&mdash;this build has been more
"How do I implement that feature that I like from this other site?"

It's built in Node, using Express for API routes, with React and Webpack for the
front end, and CSS (inc Grid) for the styling.

I particularly enjoyed using RegEx to repurpose titles into slugs (used here for
component ids and image alt tags), and tweaking media queries to suit different-
sized screens. (Still thinking about what to do for wide-screen desktops...)

This has been a great project, and I've learned so much in the process! Read more
about it [here](https://medium.com/@feminaprovita/things-i-learned-building-my-portfolio-site-7abb472599ae?source=friends_link&sk=3d5684ab10c6f127a942352beb24299b).

I'd love to hear what you think! What you liked, what you think I could (or
should) improve&mdash;if you know of a job I should apply for...
