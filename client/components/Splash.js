    <p>Welcome to clairegilligan.com!</p>
    <p>❧ ❧ ❧</p>
    <p>I've just pivoted to software development after some years working
    detail-oriented editorial jobs. I have yet to discover a portion of this
    field that I don't enjoy, but am especially intrigued by working with data.</p>
    <p>I'm certified for web development (full stack, JavaScript front
    and back end), but have been enjoying teaching myself Python so I have
    more options for data analysis projects.</p>
    <p>Currently seeking a software engineer job in NYC or DC.</p>
