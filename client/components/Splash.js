      <p>I've just pivoted to software development after some years working
      detail-oriented editorial jobs. I have yet to discover a portion of this
      field that I don't enjoy, but am especially intrigued by working with data.</p>
      <p>I'm a new graduate of the <a href="https://www.gracehopper.com">Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy of
      Code</a>, with a certificate in web development (JavaScript front and back end).
      Since graduation I've been teaching myself Python to have more options for
      data analysis projects.</p>
