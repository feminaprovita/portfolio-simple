This yields a search query that we pass to Spotify along with the relevant user data, permitting the user to play the songs and/or save the playlist to their account.",

Some are silly, some outlandish, some simply noncontroversial. People have really enjoyed having an oasis where nobody's confronting anybody, but I've asked over 800 questions by now!
